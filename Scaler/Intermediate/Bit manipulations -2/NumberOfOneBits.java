/*
 * Problem Description

Write a function that takes an integer and returns the number of 1 bits present in its binary representation.


Problem Constraints

1 <= A <= 109


Input Format

First and only argument contains integer A


Output Format

Return an integer


Example Input

Input 1:
11
Input 2:
6


Example Output

Output 1:
3
Output 2:
2


Example Explanation

Explaination 1:
11 is represented as 1011 in binary.
Explaination 2:
6 is represented as 110 in binary.
